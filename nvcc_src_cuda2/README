CUDA C implementation of the simulated annealing local search implementation
using the NVIDIA nvcc compiler

As per NVIDIA CUDA SDK (2.3) license agreement:

"This software contains source code provided by NVIDIA Corporation."

Namely, the parallel Mersenne Twister pseudo-random number generator.
Note also the data files were regenerated to have 65536 rather than
only 4096 generators, using the spawnTwisters.c program from the CUDA SDK and
dci0.4 from http://www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/~m-mat/MT/DC/dc.html

NB on tango.vpac.org must 

module load cuda
module load gcc/4.3.4

as CUDA programs will only compile with gcc 4.3 not 4.4
