"""
Functions to evaluate domain decomposition accuracy.

The accuracy of a domain decomposition is computed as overlap of predicted
(test) and assigned (reference) residues in the domain decomposition.
If a different number of domains is assigned, the decomposition is scored
as failed an no overlap is computed.

This measure is as defined by Jones et al 1998 'Domain assignment for protein
structure using a consensus approach: Characterization and analysis',
Protein Science 7:233-242.
