# TODO: quite a lot of wasted computation in building the whole
# residue distance matrix then building the SSE distance matrix from
# it - we don't really need the whole residue distance matrix, really
# only the residues that are part of SSEs. So maybe should compute
# only those and save a fair bit of computation and memory.  
# having to do all the mapping from Bio.PDB Residue objects to array
# indices is wasteful/overly complex as well, now that we maintain
# a sequential residue number system in ptgraph2.py (pdb_resid_dict)
# anyway.

class PTDistMatrix:
    """

    PTDistMatrix gives residue and secondary structure element distance
    matrices for a given list of residues and SSEs.
    
    See Peter Cock's Python programming pages for how easy it is to compute
    contact maps with with Bio.PDB and Numeric:

    http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/moac/currentstudents/peter_cock/python/protein_contact_map/

    We don't actually compute contact maps here, but different kinds
    of distance matrices (for residues, and for SSEs), and provide
    some methods on them, specifically to find the closet SSE to a given SSE.

    A third kind of distance map is also used, a sheet/sse distance map,
    where the elements are either sheets or helices. This is also a matrix
    but it is a bit odd in that since each element is the distance between
    (possibly) two sheets or a sheet and a helix, the idea that running
    along the matrix index follows sequence no longer applies (since a sheet
    consists of several strands, which may be all over the place in terms
    of the sequence numbers of the residues that make them up).
    So it is a bit unusual, but we still use a matrix for convenenience here,
    and it is actually used in ptgraph2 to find the closest sheet or helix
    to a given sheet or helix. It is built here from the sse distance
    map, which in turn is built from the residue distance map.
