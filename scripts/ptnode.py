#
# Since these are simple (linear) secondary structures, the
# PTnode will have two

# Specific PTNode types (Helix, Strand, Terminus) are derived from PTNode.

    """
    A PTnode is a node in the protein topology graph. It represents a
    secondary structure which is an alpha helix or beta strand.

    Since these are simple (linear) secnodary structures, the
    PTnode will have two
    edges, one from the previous (towards N-terminal) PTnode and one to
    the next (towards C-terminal) PTnode. So we just keep these nodes
    in a list, the ordering of which is sufficient for this purpose.

    Specific PTNode types (Helix, Strand, Terminus) are derived from this
    class.

    The 'rich comparison' operators (<, <=, <, etc.) are overridden
    so that they are integer comparison on the start residue sequence number.
    Note equality and inequality are not overriden.

        3 consecutive vectors between 4 points can define a dihedral

        Label bridge edges with '+' or '-' indicating relative side of

        For one strand with two more more neighbours, if there is H bond
        overlap (i.e. one residue in the reference strand has more than
        one neighbour) then those neighbours must be on opposite sides
        of the reference strand.

        Otherwise, they may be on the same side, (but not necessarily).
        This has to be determined by geometric criteria, specifically
        the dihedral angle (NB this is not the usual phi/psi meaning
        of dihedral, but the generic meaning of an angle between planes)
        formed between two carbon alpha atoms on the reference strand
        and one on each of the other two strands.

        Every PTNodeStrand with neighbour(s) has a bridge edge (tuple
        in the bridge_list) going out to the neighbour, and that neighbour
        symmetrically has one going back (see PTNodeStrand.add_bridge()).
        So for a strand with one neighbour, the label on the bridge edge
        is '+'; if there is more than one neighbour, the edges are labelled
        '+' for those on one side and '-' on the other.

        Test if the two strands are on opposite sides of this strand
        by using a geometric test like that described in Westhead et al 1999.

        This is determined by geometric criteria, specifically
        the dihedral angle (NB this is not the usual phi/psi meaning
        of dihedral, but the generic meaning of an angle between planes)
        between the strands.

        The dihedral angle as calculated by the Bio.PDB
        Vector module is in the range (-pi, pi] so if the absolute
        value of this angle is larger than pi/2 we say the strands
        are on opposite sides of the reference strand, else they are
        on the same side.

        If the above method fails because a common perpendicular
        cannot be found, the alternative method of averaging the dihedral
        angles for all H bonds along the SSEs is used.

        Parameters:
            strand1 - first STRAND node to test, a bridge partner of this one
